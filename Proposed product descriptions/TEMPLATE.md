## High Level Product Description Template:

These high level descriptions must include the following: 

### Summary
A brief summary of what the product will enable or improve for the user. 

### Story/Description
A longer story about the what the functionality is designed to do; what its significance and impact would be; and an argument for why now?

### User stories
A small set of user stories that discuss how this functionality would improve the system for the users. 

### Narrative Mockup
A mocked-up Narrative (written in Markdown) that:  
  1. Shows a plausible, scientifically coherent, story of how the new functionality would appear to the user. Essentially and annotated example of how a user would experience the new behaviors. This could be new scientific functionality, or simple better experience. 
  2. Clear incremental, demonstrable deliverables on the road to the full functionality. 
  3. If the new functionality requires management or analysis of data then exemplar data sets and their logic for inclusion and testing must be made available and uploaded if possible into the mock-narrative. 
  4. The new functionality is improved experience then the Narrative should be "annotated" to describe how the platform improvement would improve that experience. Many times the improvement might not directly impact the Narrative experience and that is ok as long as the improvement is described in the Narrative. 

### Citation
Citation to core external codes to be incorporated and proof of open-source

### Test plan
Should include both internal testing and external user testing/user engagement.
